What is it?

C.rb is a simple time clocker which allows you to just call the program to clock

in and just start working. When you're done for the day, just call c.rb again and 

your time will be logged. You can monitor how many hours you've clocked and 

the actual log itself.

 

How do I get it?

You can install it quickly to your desktop (OS X) using the following bash cmd:

cd ~/Desktop/;curl -o c.rb https://gist.github.com/raw/857843/C.rb; alias c="ruby ~/Desktop/c.rb"


How do I use it?

Save the c.rb script somewhere on your harddrive, doesn't really matter where.

Now in your .bash_profile you should add the following line:

alias c="ruby /path/c.rb"
 

Does it have any other features?

C.rb is a pretty straight to the point script, however it does feature some 

pleasantries like log which will show you a log of your log in/out dates

times. Another option ? tells you if you're still clocked in, and total displays

how many hours you have clocked in thus far. If you can't remember any

of these then you can  use help as an argument and you can get a pretty

list of functionality.

 

Windows? Quite Certainly!

Windows users need to follow some different steps. You will need to install

Ruby. Then set up a Windows terminal command that runs the script. This

information can be found at Microsoft's site. Essentially you will still set up

ruby to run the c.rb file regardless of what platform you are on. You just

need to have Ruby.
